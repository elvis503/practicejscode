// Write a function called factorial which accepts a number and returns the factorial of that number. A factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it. 4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24;

function factorial(number){
   if(number <= 1){
     return 1;
   }else{
     let total = number;
     number -= 1;
     total = total * number;
     return total * factorial(number - 1);
   }
}
